# ATLIQ-Sales-and-Finance-report
In this project, I learned how to create reports that analyze customer performance and compare market performance with sales targets. By working with tools like Power Query, Power Pivot, and DAX, I developed skills to organize and analyze data effectively. I gained the ability to interpret sales data, identify trends, and track key indicators, enabling better decision-making and efficient resource allocation.

Additionally, I created Profit and Loss (P&L) reports to evaluate financial performance and practiced communicating insights with stakeholders. This helped me understand the importance of financial reports in informed decision-making, financial stability, and strategic planning.

Through this project, I realized how sales and financial reports are vital in todayâ€™s competitive business environment, where data-driven decisions, customized offerings, and profitability are essential for success.
